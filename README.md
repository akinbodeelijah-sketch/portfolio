## MY PROJECTS

*A glimpse of some of the project I've been working on.*

# 📑 Project: Torilo Academy Vulnerability Report

## Objective
To perform a vulnerability and information gathering assessment on **toriloacademy.com**.

## Methodology
- **OSINT**: WHOIS, DNS, IP lookup  
- **Port Scanning**: Nmap scan  
- **Web App Testing**: Wapiti, OWASP ZAP, SQLmap  
- **Wi-Fi & Network Security**: Not applicable (web-based only)  

## Findings
- Missing HTTP Security Headers (X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.)  
- WAF detection (site returns different responses for attack strings)  
- No SQL Injection or XSS detected in limited tests  
- SSL certificate inspected (Let's Encrypt, valid but basic configuration)  

## Deliverables
