## 👤 ABOUT ME

I am currently studying **Business Administration**, but I have developed a keen interest in **cybersecurity**.  I am motivated by the need to understand how technology, businesses, and people interact, and how cybersecurity protects these elements.  

My focus areas include:
- **Information Gathering & OSINT**
- **Web Application Security**
- **Network Security (Wi-Fi & Traffic Analysis)**
- **Vulnerability Assessment**

## MY PROJECTS

*A glimpse of some of the project I've been working on.*

# 📑 Project: Torilo Academy Vulnerability Report

## Objective
To perform a vulnerability and information gathering assessment on **toriloacademy.com**.

## Methodology
- **OSINT**: WHOIS, DNS, IP lookup  
- **Port Scanning**: Nmap, Masscan, and Zenmap, Nikto 
- **Web App Testing**: Wapiti, OWASP ZAP, SQLmap  
- **Wi-Fi & Network Security**: Not applicable (web-based only)  

## Findings
- Missing HTTP Security Headers (X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.)  
- WAF detection (site returns different responses for attack strings)  
- No SQL Injection or XSS detected in limited tests  
- SSL certificate inspected (Let's Encrypt, valid but basic configuration)  

## Deliverables
A full report in PDF format: [Torilo Academy Vulnerability Report](../reports/toriloacademy-report.pdf)  

# 🧪 Project: Web Application Security Lab

## Objective
To practice common web application vulnerabilities using controlled environments.  

## Activities
- Simulated **SQL Injection** with SQLmap  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** testing  
- **Directory brute forcing**  
- **Authentication testing** with brute login forms  

## Tools  
- OWASP ZAP  
- Wapiti  
- Burp Suite

# 📡 Project: Wi-Fi Security Lab

## Objective
To analyze and understand Wi-Fi vulnerabilities and traffic interception.  

## Activities
- Captured Wi-Fi handshakes  
- Performed ARP spoofing with **Ettercap, Bettercap**  
- Analyzed traffic with **Wireshark**  
- Learned about WPA2 security and password cracking methods  

## Tools
